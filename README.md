An Hex Game in HTML5

This is a try to make a little version in javascript of board game Hex : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)

The principal reason to make it, is for learning the canvas object of HTML5.

It's unfinished, and it's sure I'm gonna change a lot of things in it. By example the method to enumerate hexagon cells
is a disaster. Very complicated to work.
